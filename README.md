# Big-Data-Tools Coursework 2019-20
The repository holds the coursework of Big Data Tools and Technique course at the University of Salford, UK, by Karishma Prasad. 
The current study focusses on applications of Big Data in the health care industry. The aim is to analyse and visualise the real-life medical data using the Big Data tools and techniques. The data is provided by the University of Salford comprising of ‘Imaging’, ’Diagnoses’ and ‘Hearing evaluation’.
Seven problem statements are given which needed to be computed using the pyspark implementations.

#### Implementations 
For the current exercise, Linux bash script is used for data pre-processing (as shown on the Jupyter Notebook). Two major implementations are carried out on Jupyter Notebook: <li>
  1. RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets)
  2. Dataframes </li>
  
#### Visualisation 
In the current exercise, visualisation is attached to each seven problem statements. The visualisation was done using python libraries like pandas, seaborne, matplotlib (as shown in the code).
